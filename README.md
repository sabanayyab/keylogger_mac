To run the Python keylogger code on your macOS, follow these steps:
1. Install Python (if not already installed)

macOS usually comes with Python pre-installed, but you can check your version using the following command in the terminal:

bash

python3 --version

If Python 3 is not installed, you can install it via Homebrew:

bash

brew install python

2. Install pynput Library

The pynput library allows you to monitor and control input devices like keyboards. You need to install this library before running the script.

Run this command in the terminal:

bash

pip install pynput

If you are using Python 3, you might need to use pip3 instead of pip:

bash

pip3 install pynput

3. Create the Python Script

    Open a text editor (such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or even the built-in TextEdit in plain text mode).
    Copy the keylogger code from your earlier post or from the README file.
    Save the file with a .py extension (e.g., keylogger.py).

4. Run the Keylogger Script

To run the Python script:

    Open the terminal.

    Navigate to the directory where your script is saved. For example, if it's saved in the Documents folder:

    bash

cd ~/Documents

Run the script using Python:

bash

    python3 keylogger.py

If you are using Python 2 (though it's not recommended), use python instead of python3.
5. Check the Log File

Once the script starts, it will record all keypresses and save them to a file named mac_keylog.txt in the same directory where the script is running.

You can open this file using a text editor to view the logged keys.
6. Stop the Keylogger

The keylogger will continue running until you press the Esc key. Pressing Esc will stop the listener and terminate the script.
